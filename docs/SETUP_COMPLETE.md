# Company of One - Setup Complete âœ…

## What's Been Set Up

1. **Project Structure**
   - âœ… Created `frontend/` directory for Next.js app
   - âœ… Created `backend/` directory for Express.js API
   - âœ… Created `content/` directory for content strategy

2. **Development Environment**
   - âœ… Installed TypeScript and dev dependencies
   - âœ… Created `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript configuration
   - âœ… Created `.eslintrc.json` for code linting
   - âœ… All npm scripts are ready to use

3. **Agent Orchestrator**
   - âœ… Ready to deploy 4 parallel agents
   - âœ… State tracking initialized

## Next Steps

Run the orchestrator to see available tasks:
```bash
npm run orchestrate
```

The orchestrator has identified 4 tasks ready to run in parallel:
1. API Infrastructure Setup (3 hours)
2. Design System Creation (3 hours)  
3. Content Development (4 hours)
4. Next.js Project Initialization (2 hours)

To deploy agents, copy each command from the orchestrator output into separate terminal windows or Cursor background agents.

## Project Architecture

This project uses a multi-agent development approach where:
- Multiple AI agents work in parallel on different aspects
- The orchestrator manages dependencies and task sequencing
- Each agent focuses on a specific domain (design, content, frontend, backend, etc.)
- Progress is tracked automatically

## Key Files

- `scripts/agent-orchestrator.js` - Main orchestration logic
- `package.json` - Project scripts and dependencies
- `README.md` - Project overview and quick start guide

The project is now ready for parallel agent deployment! ðŸš€
