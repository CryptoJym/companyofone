### Email 2: Day 1 - Preparation Tips
**Subject:** 3 questions to maximize your consultation tomorrow

**Body:**
Hi [First Name],

Your consultation is coming up soon! To make sure you get maximum value from our time together, here are 3 questions to think about:

1. **"What would need to change for me to work 20 hours less per week?"**
   (This reveals your biggest time drains and automation opportunities)

2. **"Which of my current activities directly generate revenue?"**
   (Most solopreneurs are shocked when they actually calculate this)

3. **"If I could clone myself for one task, what would it be?"**
   (This is usually where our AI assistants provide immediate ROI)

I've helped 1,000+ solopreneurs answer these questions, and the insights always lead to breakthrough moments.

Also, I noticed you haven't downloaded the Weekly Reset Template yet. It only takes 5 minutes to implement:

Can't wait to dive deep into your business!

P.S. Tomorrow I'll share the #1 mistake that keeps solopreneurs stuck at their current revenue level (and the simple fix).

### Email 3: Day 2 - Common Mistake
**Subject:** The $100K ceiling nobody talks about

**Body:**
Hi [First Name],

There's a revenue ceiling that traps 90% of solopreneurs, and it's not what you think.

It's not about:
- Working harder (you're already doing that)
- Better marketing (you know your stuff)
- More clients (that often makes it worse)

The real problem? You're still operating like an employee in your own business.

Let me explain...

When you started, you traded your 9-5 for working 24/7. You handle everything because "nobody does it like you do." Sound familiar?

Here's what our most successful members discovered:

**Sarah (marketing consultant):** "I was stuck at $8K/month working 70 hours. Now I'm at $25K/month working 30 hours."

**Marcus (SaaS founder):** "Broke through $500K ARR by doing LESS, not more."

The secret? They stopped trying to do everything and started building systems that work without them.

During your consultation, I'll show you exactly how to:
- Identify the 20% of activities that generate 80% of your revenue
- Automate or eliminate everything else
- Build systems that scale infinitely without hiring

Your consultation is in [X days]. Ready to break through your ceiling?

[Signature]

P.S. I'm attaching a case study of how Emily 10x'd her course business while taking Fridays off. Worth a quick read.

### Email 4: Day 3 - Social Proof
**Subject:** How Marcus hit $500K with no employees

**Body:**
Hi [First Name],

Remember Marcus from yesterday's email? I asked if he'd share his story with you.

Here's what he said:

"18 months ago, I was considering shutting down. My SaaS was making $4K/month, but I was working constantly and burning out fast.

Then I joined Company of One and everything changed.

First, they helped me see I was wasting 30 hours/week on tasks that didn't move the needle. Their AI assistants now handle all my customer support, content creation, and even basic development tasks.

Second, the strategic consulting showed me I was targeting the wrong customers. One positioning change 3x'd my conversion rate overnight.

But the biggest game-changer? The community. Having other solopreneurs who've been there to bounce ideas off is invaluable. It's like having a board of advisors on speed dial.

Result: $500K ARR, working 4 days a week, and actually enjoying my business again."

Want results like Marcus? Your consultation is the first step.

We'll create your custom roadmap to scale without the chaos.

[Signature]

P.S. Fun fact: 73% of our members report working fewer hours within 30 days while making more money. The system works.

### Email 5: Day 5 - Urgency/Scarcity

### Email 2: Day 3 - Address Common Objection
**Subject:** "I don't have time to implement a new system"

**Body:**
Hi [First Name],

I've been thinking about our conversation, specifically when you mentioned [specific challenge they're facing].

You know what the #1 objection I hear is?

"This sounds amazing, but I don't have time to implement a new system."

I get it. You're already maxed out. The thought of adding ONE more thing feels impossible.

But here's what Sarah told me last week:

"I almost didn't join because I was working 70-hour weeks. I literally didn't have time to breathe. But the first week, the AI assistants saved me 15 hours. By week 4, I had my life back."

The truth is: You don't have time NOT to implement this system.

Every week you wait is another week of:
- Working nights and weekends
- Turning down opportunities because you're maxed out
- Watching competitors grow while you're stuck

We designed Company of One for busy solopreneurs. That's why we:
- Do the heavy lifting for you (setup, training, implementation)
- Start with quick wins that free up time immediately
- Provide done-for-you templates and systems

Still on the fence? Let's hop on a quick 15-minute call to address any concerns.

### Email 3: Day 7 - Case Study
**Subject:** From $5K to $50K/month (Emily's story)

**Body:**
Hi [First Name],

I asked Emily if I could share her story with you because it reminded me of your situation.

Here's what she said:

"A year ago, I was making $5K/month from my course business and ready to give up. I was doing everything 'right' but couldn't break through.

The consultation opened my eyes. I was spending 80% of my time on things that didn't matter. I was afraid to invest in help because money was tight.

But I took the leap with Company of One and:

Month 1: AI assistants freed up 20 hours/week
Month 2: New positioning doubled my conversion rate
Month 3: Automated my entire fulfillment process
Month 6: Hit $25K/month working 4 days/week
Month 12: $50K/month and took a month-long vacation

The ROI was insane. I made back my investment in the first month just from the time I saved."

Emily started exactly where you are now. The only difference? She took action.

### Email 2: Day 2 - Implementation Tips
**Subject:** The 10-minute trick that 3x'd Sarah's productivity

**Body:**
Hi [First Name],

Did you try the Weekly Reset Template yet?

If not, here's the shortest version possible:

Every Sunday, write down:
1. Three wins from last week (build momentum)
2. Three priorities for this week (maintain focus)
3. One thing to eliminate (create space)

That's it. 10 minutes max.

Sarah started doing just this and 3x'd her productive hours. Not because of magic, but because of clarity.

The full template takes it deeper, but start here if you're pressed for time.

### Email 3: Day 4 - Success Story
**Subject:** He saved 20 hours with one template

**Body:**
Hi [First Name],

Just got this message from David:

"I've tried every productivity system out there. Nothing stuck. But your Weekly Reset Template? Game-changer. I saved 20 hours in my first week just by eliminating tasks that didn't align with my three priorities. Why didn't anyone teach me this sooner?"

Here's why it works:

Most productivity systems add complexity. Ours removes it.

Instead of managing 50 tasks, you focus on 3 priorities.
Instead of working harder, you work on what matters.
Instead of feeling overwhelmed, you feel in control.

This template is just one of 47 systems in Company of One.

Imagine implementing all of them.
