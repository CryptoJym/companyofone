## The Company of One Story

### Building Empires of One

In 2019, our founder was drowning. 

Running a "successful" consulting business with 12 employees, he was working 80-hour weeks, managing constant fires, and watching profits disappear into overhead. The breaking point came during a family vacation he couldn't enjoy‚Äîanswering emails at 2 AM while his kids slept.

That's when the radical thought hit: What if bigger isn't better?

Over the next year, he systematically reduced his team from 12 to 1 (himself), automated everything possible, and focused only on high-value work. The result? Revenue increased by 40%, profit margins hit 85%, and he was working 30 hours a week.

Friends in business started asking how he did it. Word spread. Soon, he was teaching other burned-out entrepreneurs the "Company of One" methodology.

Today, Company of One is the leading platform for solopreneurs who want to build thriving businesses without building teams.
