## Pain Points Section

### Section Header
Sound Familiar?

### Pain Point 1: The Time Trap
**Headline:** Working 60+ Hours a Week But Still Behind?
**Description:** You started your business for freedom, but now you're working more hours than ever. Every task feels urgent, and there's never enough time to work ON your business instead of IN it.

### Pain Point 2: Investment Paralysis
**Headline:** Unsure Which Tools Actually Drive Growth?
**Description:** You've spent thousands on courses, software, and "game-changing" solutions. But you're still guessing which investments actually move the needle versus just drain your budget.

### Pain Point 3: Admin Overwhelm
**Headline:** Drowning in Tasks That Don't Make Money?
**Description:** Invoicing, scheduling, email management, bookkeeping... The administrative work never ends. You're spending more time on busywork than on what you do best.

### Pain Point 4: Solo Struggle
**Headline:** Making Big Decisions Completely Alone?
**Description:** No team to brainstorm with. No mentor to guide you. Just you, your laptop, and the weight of every decision. The isolation is real, and it's holding you back.
