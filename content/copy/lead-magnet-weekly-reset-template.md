# The Solopreneur's Weekly Reset Template

## Transform Your Productivity in 30 Minutes Every Sunday

### The Problem with Traditional Planning

Most productivity systems are designed for teams, not solopreneurs. They're complex, time-consuming, and create more overwhelm than clarity.

As a solopreneur, you need a system that:
- Takes minutes, not hours
- Creates clarity, not complexity  
- Focuses on outcomes, not activities
- Adapts to your energy, not just your time

The Weekly Reset Template is that system.

## The Power Multipliers

### The 2-Minute Capture
Throughout the week, capture:
- Tasks that took longer than expected
- Activities that gave unexpected energy
- Decisions that created the most value
- Moments of flow state

Review these during your next Weekly Reset.

### The Energy-First Schedule
Schedule your highest-value work during your peak energy times. Use low-energy times for routine tasks.

### The One-Touch Rule
When planning a task, immediately:
1. Estimate time needed
2. Assign to a specific day/time
3. Identify first action
4. Define "done"

### The Weekly CEO Review
Every Friday, spend 10 minutes asking:
- What would I tell my "employee" (myself) to keep doing?
- What would I tell them to stop doing?
- What support do they need?

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Over-Planning
Three priorities are plenty. If everything is important, nothing is.

Learning from last week prevents repeating mistakes.

Share your priorities. Accountability accelerates achievement.
